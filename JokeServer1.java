Compilation: go to file location and "javac JokeServer.java". this should create 4 class file in that same folder
Exicution: open more thank on terminal and got to location where you have the class file(compiled from befor code it should be same location)
"java ColorClient" to run client and send request to server
"java ColorServer" to run the server. And now you can start sending requests.

// Joke Server class
/*
The Joke Server listens for incoming client connections on port 4545.
It has a worker thread to handle each client connection.
The server can toggle between "joke" and "proverb" modes using an admin connection on port 5050.
When a client connects, it receives either a joke cycle or a proverb cycle based on the current server mode.
The server maintains conversation state for each client, ensuring that they receive unique jokes or proverbs in each cycle.

/*Comments:-
I did the same hashmapping but I was only able to toggle between cycles, if I was on joke mode toggled it to
proverb mode proverbs  were coming only after all jokes in cycle were completed even though mode was changed 
in server. Did you encounter similar problem while implementing?


I also tried same additional feature but I couldn't handle hashmap properly, I should have started little earlier&nbsp;
